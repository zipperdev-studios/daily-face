    infoDesc: `Daily Face is an app that expresses today's mood by classifying it into five categories along with various weather information every day. The face classification criteria are "Very Great", "Good", "Meh", "Not Good", and "Really Bad". Each face will change according to today's weather and discomfort index. Also, simple phrases are expressed. You can edit this phrase in the Customize menu in the Settings window :)`
