# Daily Face 데일리 페이스

Daily Face is an app that expresses today's mood by classifying it into five categories
along with various weather information every day. The face classification criteria are
"Very Great", "Good", "Meh", "Not Good", and "Really Bad". Each face will change according
to today's weather and discomfort index. Also, simple phrases are expressed.
You can edit this phrase in the Customize menu in the Settings window :)

데일리 페이스는 매일 여러 날씨 정보와 함께 오늘의 기분을 총 5가지로 분류하여 표현해주는 앱입니다.
페이스 분류 기준은 "아주 좋음", "좋음", "보통", "나쁨", "아주 나쁨"으로 분류가 됩니다.
각 페이스는 오늘의 날씨와 불쾌지수에 따라 변하게 됩니다. 또 간단한 어구도 같이 표현이 되있습니다.
이 어구는 설정 창의 커스터마이징 메뉴에서 수정 하실 수 있습니다 :)
